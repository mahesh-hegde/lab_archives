## Lab programs archive

This is archive of lab programs for few labs from 3rd sem (Data Structures, OS) and 4th sem (OOP).

Compared to other versions of these lab programs you'd find on in the college peer-to-peer, these are often better written, do better error handling and implement additional features. But often these also deviate from the question, go deeper than required, or use 'arcane' language features like enums and assert.

This is not suggested to read these programs or use as reference, especially for lab exams.

Have not uploaded DAA & MCES because the programs are too similar to what one would find in college peer-to-peer.
